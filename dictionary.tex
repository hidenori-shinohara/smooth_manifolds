\subsection{Topological Manifolds}

\begin{defn}[Topological Manifold]
  A topological $n$-manifold is a Hausdorff, second-countable topological space each point of which has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Coordinates]\label{topological_manifolds_coordinates}
  Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
  Let $U$ be an open subset of $M$, $\hat{U}$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\phi: U \rightarrow \hat{U}$ be a homeomorphism.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The pair $(U, \phi)$ is called a coordinate chart or a chart.
    \item
      $U$ is called a coordinate domain or a coordinate neighborhood.
    \item
      If $\phi(U)$ is an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $U$ is called a coordinate ball.
    \item
      If $\phi(U)$ is an open cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $U$ is called a coordinate cube and $\phi$ is called a coordinate map.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\subsection{Smooth Manifolds}

\begin{defn}[Transition Map]
  Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold and $(U, \phi), (V, \psi)$ be coordinate charts (\ref{topological_manifolds_coordinates}) such that $U \cap V \ne \emptyset$.
  $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(U \cap V) \mapsto \psi(U \cap V)$ is called a transition map from $\phi$ to $\psi$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Smoothly Compatible]
  Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
  Two coordinate charts $(U, \phi), (V, \psi)$ are called smoothly compatible if $U \cap V = \emptyset$ or the transition map $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism.
\end{defn}
