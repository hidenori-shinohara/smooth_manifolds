  Show that equivalent definitions of manifolds are obtained if instead of allowing $U$ to be homeomorphic to \textit{any} open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we require it to be homeomorphic to an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, or to $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself.
\end{customexer}

\begin{proof}
  It is clear that a ``manifold" satisfying the open-ball or $\mathbb{R}^n$ definition satisfies the open-subset definition.
  Let $M$ be a manifold satisfying the open-subset definition.
  Let $x \in M$ be given and let $U, \hat{U}, \phi$ be given according to the definition.
  Since $\hat{U}$ is open, there exists an open ball $B$ such that $\phi(x) \in B \subset \hat{U}$.
  Restrict $\phi$ to $\phi^{-1}(B)$.
  Then $\phi^{-1}(B)$ is an open subset of $M$ containing $x$, and $\phi\mid_{\phi^{-1}(B)}$ is a homeomorphism between $\phi^{-1}(B)$ and $B$.
  Thus $M$ satisfies the open-ball definition.

  $B(x, r) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the map $(x_1 + a_1, \cdots, x_n + a_n) \mapsto (\frac{a_1}{r - a_1}, \cdots, \frac{a_n}{r - a_n})$ where $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ is the center of $B(x, r)$ and $r$ is the radius.
  Since the composition of two homeomorphisms gives a homeomorphism, $M$ also satisfies the $\mathbb{R}^n$ definition as well.

  Showt that $\RP^n$ is Hausdorff and second-countable, and is therefore a topological $n$-manifold.
\end{customexer}

\begin{proof}
  Let $[x], [y] \in \RP^n$ be given.
  Without loss of generality, assume $x, y \in S^{n - 1}$.
  Let $r = \min\{ \abs{x - y}, \abs{x + y} \} / 2$.
  Then $q(B(x, r)), q(B(y, r))$ contain $[x], [y]$, respectively.
  $q^{-1}(U_x), q^{-1}(U_y)$ are both open in $\mathbb{R}^n$, so $U_x, U_y$ are both open in $\RP^n$.
  Let $[z] \in U_x \cap U_y$.
  Then $z \in q^{-1}(\{ [z] \}) \subset q^{-1}(U_x \cap U_y) = q^{-1}(U_x) \cap q^{-1}(U_y) = \{ 0 \}$, but $z \ne 0$ because $q: \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{ 0 \} \rightarrow \RP^n$.
  Therefore, $U_x, U_y$ are disjoint, so $\RP^n$ is Hausdorff.
